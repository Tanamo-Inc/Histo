        <h2>Our Identity Today</h2>
        <p>
            In Ghana now, most locals of IMCS are born in already existing chaplaincies where many other subgroups or
            organizations are at work. Subgroups such as Charismatic Renewal group, Legion of Mary, Choir, different
            Marian groups came into existence after these IMCS Locals were formed in the chaplaincies. IMCS does embrace
            all the Catholic Student Communities and it represents them. As a result of the quasi parish nature of the
            chaplaincies, the activities of IMCS locals sometimes have activities like, retreat, Mass and programs like
            campaigns against HIV/AIDS, Sickle Cell Awareness, community Empowerment and outreaches. This awareness was
            felt by action orientations that became more and more concise on some of our campuses. In furtherance to
            this, the National Office would be seeking the counsel and support of the Ghana Catholic Bishop Conference
            on and in what the National Movement’s locals or institutions do in the Church in Ghana,
        </p>

        <h2>The University Pastoral Work</h2>
        <p>
            As IMCS grew over the years and adapted itself to the realities it was faced, in Ghana, with the growth of
            the Church’s pastoral activities in universities. In some mission countries, many Catholic Universities were
            established and the concern to foster spiritual care for the university community (Lectures, administration
            and the families) was kindled. University parishes exercising full parish responsibilities and having
            organizations were founded; this meant community of Catholic Students had then parish committees. All
            movements and organizations recognized by the parish found their place in it. The situation is not
            farfetched in Ghana.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Ghana for non-Catholic universities, the concern to carter for the spiritual needs of the students was
            met within the creation of Catholic Chaplaincies. Often, a movement particularly IMCS, became the reason for
            establishing a chaplaincy which in turn became representative of the Catholic Students Community. As time
            went on these University Chaplaincies developed and became known as University Parishes by Local Ordinaries
            or Bishops. With the change from one to another, some tensions have been encountered and IMCS humbly had to
            give up its place to a higher authority and the personality of University Parishes had a determining effect
            on the transition and performance of the IMCS Movement activities. Currently, many students feel they are
            Catholics but not IMCS-Pax Romana members in these Parish Chaplaincies. That is, the IMCS Movement has now
            become a movement of choice by the Catholic Students in these Parish Chaplaincies. Pax Romana in the
            Tertiary institutions is virtually becoming optional society for the Catholic Students due to wrong
            orientation. This has led to the lack of smooth relationship between some locals with their Chaplains and
            gradually resulted in their participation in some of the National Programs.

        <h2>IMCS Ghana Federation Coordination</h2>
        <p>The basic logistics such as an office, human and financial recourses needed to make administrative work
            smooth is nothing to write home about, coupled with our inability to create a transitional structure for the
            graduates to form a strong Alumni (ICMICA) front in the country for some years now and our inability to
            permeate the Arch/Diocese structure which in turn will trickle down to deaneries and to the parish levels
            has militated our coordination and adversely affected our financial status. The slow or non- payment of dues
            by locals cannot be overlooked. The non-permanent places of worship in some of our locals have always been a
            long standing issue. The National Office has developed a ten year Action Plan for the Movement 2014-2024,
            which will see to the establishment of PAX ALUMNI in our various locals to strengthen the emerging national
            front, start a long term income generating project-Cloth Production to end the period of “intellectual
            begging”, acquiring an office through the help of the Bishops’ Conference and GHANCYC and ensuring financial
            sustainability and self-reliance. </p>
