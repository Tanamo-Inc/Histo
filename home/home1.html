            In Ghana, it all started as St. Thomas Aquinas society-the Patron Saint of all Catholic Intellectuals or
            students of Higher learning, at the then University College of Gold Coast, now University of Ghana, Legon,
            1949. In 1959, the Aquinas society held its first Annual General Conference. Rev. Prof. Raymond Korster (MAY
            HIS SOUL REST IN PEACE), a former lecturer at the then University College of Gold Coast, Legon was the first
            National Chaplain. He served the movement from 1949 to 1978. After him was Rev. Fr. Osei-Bonsu, now Bishop
            Osei-Bonsu, the President of the Ghana Catholic Bishops Conference, who also served, as a chaplain from the
            early 1980’s. The Chaplain’s position became vacant somewhere in the mid 1980’s to the early 90’s when Rev.
            Fr. John Opoku-Agyemang, now Rev. Msgr. Dr. John Opoku-Agyemang was appointed as National Chaplain and has
            been till date.

            In 1957, the Ghana Federation hosted the first Pan African Seminar of IMCS. It is worth noting also that,
            the 5th Pan African Assembly was held at University of Science and Technology (UST), Kumasi, now Kwame
            Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Ghana in September 1990. As originally named, the St.
            Thomas Aquinas Society, this baby has risen gradually and steadily, powered by the grace of God, later on
            obtaining international recognition, thereby assuming the name INTERNATIONAL MOVEMENT OF CATHOLIC STUDENTS
            (IMCS)-PAX ROMANA GHANA FEDERATION, until today when its 67years in the youth formation. IMCS-Pax Romana
            Ghana currently exists in over eighty (80) tertiary institutions which include Public and Private
            Universities, University Colleges, Polytechnics, Professional Institutions, Specialized Institutions,
            Seminaries and Health Trainee Institutions.
