            The movement which is faith based has the primary mission of evangelisation and empowerment in the student
            milieu. It focuses on providing deep rooted Christian formation and intellectual exposures for students in a
            constantly changing and contemporary world. Over the years, it has been the hub for the grooming of human
            resource not only for the Church but to serve the various facet of human endeavour. It is not surprising
            that IMCS – Pax Romana remains one of the most vibrant, growing, and challenging Catholic intellectual
            organisations in the sixty-one member tertiary institutions in which the movement exist nationwide. With our
            desire to enhance our intellectual, spiritual formation and spreading the Lord’s peace aboard; it pleases us
            to make our identity known to all within the tertiary environment and even beyond. However, with the over
            ten thousand Catholic Tertiary Students in the country, there are at times the lost art of commitment and
            apathy on the part of students and some chaplains towards the activities of the National Movement.
